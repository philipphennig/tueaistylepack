# tueaistylepack
Style pack for the Tübingen AI Center, with templates for slides, theses, and more. 

This repository contains templates for documents under the branding of the Tübingen AI Center. The bulk of the contents is licensed under the MIT license, with the exception of the logo files, which are ``all rights reserved'' and should only be used by faculty, employees and students of the AI Center, with the correct affiliations. 

The pack currently contains the following LaTeX assets:
* a general color scheme providing the color scheme of the center
* a template for beamer slides, with various macros
* a template for Master's and Bachelor's theses that follows the content guidelines of the Tübingen CS department. 
 
These documents have matching style sheets in the [`tueplots`](https://tueplots.readthedocs.io/) python library, which can be used to generate plots that match the style of the documents.

If you would like to contribute to this repository, please feel free to open an issue or a pull request. In particular, we welcome proposals for templates for posters, and PhD theses.

## Contributors:

This repo is maintained by Philipp Hennig, who also wrote the thesis template. The beamer template is based on an earlier template built by Philipp Hennig and Marvin Pförtner. 

The color scheme, the Tübingen AI Logo, and various other design assets were developed by Franziska Schwarz.
